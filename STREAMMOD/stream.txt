STREAM -> they are objects thatled you read data from a source or write data to a destination in continuous fashion.In node.js,there are four types of streams-
Streaming means listening to music or watching video in real time instead of downloading a file to your computer and watching it later.

1. readable-> stream which is used for read operation
2. Writable-> Stream which is used for write operation
3.Duplex->Stream which can be used for both read and write operation \
4.Transform->A type of duplex stream where the output is computed based on input

//finsally read by stream

Each type of Stream is an EventEmitter instance and throws several events at different instance of times.For example,
some of the commonly used event are
DATA-> This event is fired when there is data is available to read.
END->This event is fired when there is no more data to read         
ERROR-> This event is fired when there is any error receiving or writing data.
FINISH->This event is fired when all the data has been flushed to underlying system

stream.pipe()-> the method used to take a readable stream and connect it to a writable stream
